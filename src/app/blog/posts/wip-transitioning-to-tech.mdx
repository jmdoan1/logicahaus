<h1 style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Background</h1>

In 2012, I graduated from college with a bachelor's degree in accounting. Accounting was kind of a random choice after I squandered my first two years on the PR track. When it came time to pick a new major, my mom was adamant that I choose something in "business", as "that's where the money is most consistent". While it was a random decision, I actually kind of liked it, as my brain had was very logically and mathematically inclined and I grew up with an almost morbid curiosity about how businesses worked under the hood. I even originally picked PR due to my childhood curiosity about how businesses talked a certain way to be interpreted by the masses to mean one thing while being able to legally claim they meant another.

I did actually find accounting to be very conceptually interesting. Being an accountant requires understanding every aspect of the business you work for, being one of the few people entrusted with almost every available piece of data, and this was at least enough. However, after entering the actual workforce, I quickly learned I was not built for the career in question. To this day, I can guarantee you that no matter how taxic your most toxic job was, the accounting department had it worse.

Unless you're working at an accounting firm, the accounting department is one of the only non-revenue-generating departments in any company. This means zero consideration given when it comes to quality tooling, quality of life, or basically anything that doesn't lead to getting reports ready for shareholders as soon as possible, and they don't care how uncooperative the other departments are at helping you gather accurite information, as that's really just a distraction from the actual bottom line. The departments are full of elitists who care about nothing more than title and are not afraid to use others as a step on the ladder to senior->manager->controller->VP->CFO. You are also beholden to KPIs that have to improve every quarter, usually meaning the only thing you can do is the same thing you've done but faster and faster, as there is no room innovation in accounting. Every innovative accountant you know is a criminal with a Netflix documentary. This means your only choice is to work yourself to the point of burnout and then keep burning. Working anything under a 60-80 hour week is considered lack of commitment. And that's just an average week, don't even get me started on the monthly/quarterly/annual "close periods", i.e. the time between when a financial period ends and when the books have to be closed for reporting.

This was not a game I was willing to play, and I became a master at figuring out the least amount of work I could do to leave the office at 5pm without getting fired (spoiler alert: I actually got fired from every accounting position I've ever held).

My one saving grace came in the form of Excel. The beauty and elegance of my automation was unmatched. You should have seen my formulas
