[ForHire] Full Stack Software Engineer - Fully Responsive Hybrid iOS/Android/Web Apps - Native Apps - SEO Optimized Websites - Scalable Backend APIs - Database Management - Fintech/Healthtech/Edtech - and more!

Hello, my name is Jay and I run a one-man "agency" called [LogicaHaus](https://www.logica.haus/).

Beyond my 10+ years of experience in software development, I also held a previous career in accounting and business management, which, depending on the nature of your project, adds an additional wealth of knowledge and understanding where other devs may just be focused on the code.

# Services

### Hybrid App Development

- #### React Native
  - One codebase compiles to both iOS and Android
  - Reaches a broader audience faster and with a lower budget
  - Gives your users the same UI/UX experience across all devices
  - Allows platform-specific logic
  - Occasionally slower to adopt new native iOS/Android features
  - [Example](https://www.logica.haus/projects/scenepin)
- #### Expo
  - React Native wrapper with additional support for websites
  - Removes some complexity of managing the React Native development environment
  - Occasionally slower to adopt new React Native features, but is slowly becoming the default for new open-source packages
  - [Example](https://www.logica.haus/projects/spirated)

### Native And Platform-Specific Development

- #### Native iOS and Android
  - Gives users a UI/UX experience that feels more natural to their device
  - Full access to the latest features of each platform
  - Requires creation and management of two frontend codebases, adding either time or additional manpower
  - May be a good option if:
    - Your app requires a feature only available on one platform
    -
  - [Example (iOS)](https://www.logica.haus/projects/mileage-quest)
- #### Web
  - **React**
    - State-driven UI updates
    - Able to make changes to only part of the DOM without requiring a full re-render
    - Utilization of reusable components and functions
    - Serves as the basis for React Native and Expo mentioned above
  - **Next.js**
    - React wrapper that allows for Server Side Rendering
    - Improves SEO performance
    - [Example](https://www.logica.haus/)
- #### Windows
  - GUI applications and automation
  - No Specific examples to claim as all work in this realm was done under full-time employment, where I built Ad-Hoc applications for automating content streaming for live news broadcasters + cable and digital tv providers
- #### MacOS
  - GUI applications and automation
  - [Example](https://www.logica.haus/projects/keepawayk)

### Custom Backend and API Development

- .NET, Express.js, Node.js, Nest.js

### Database Management

- Relational databases such as SQL, SQLite, Postgres, etc
  - High level of experience includes developing large stored procedures and optimizing queries for more streamlined query execution paths
- Non-relational databases such as MongoDB
  - Provides a slightly more streamlined development experience on the frontend
- 3rd party solutions such as firebase and supabase
  - Often a good choice for smaller applications that can expect to stay within the free tiers for a while before spending time on in-house solutions
  - Scaling automatically managed by provider

### 3rd Party API Integrations

-
